**Zero-Days: Windows' Hidden Gems.**

<!-- truncate -->

Greetings! I’m trustinveritas, the digital sentry behind this blog. A native of Switzerland, I’ve now made my home in Zurich. You may follow my GitHub, where I have been sharing my cybersecurity expertise.

I’m a cybersecurity specialist by day, writer by night. My lifelong fascination with the digital world compels me to share my knowledge and experiences with you, including the hacks, OSINT adventures, and my exploits in Capture The Flag (CTF) games. If you ever spot an error in my techniques or tips, well, let’s consider that a fun challenge for you to troubleshoot.

If the cyber world’s intricacies and mysteries don’t quite strike your fancy, perhaps this will: my absolute favorite tea blend. It’s got the robustness of a solid firewall, the subtlety of a well-crafted phishing email, and a hint of mischief, just like a good hacker. Give it a try, you might just like it!
